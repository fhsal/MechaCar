# MechaCar

CWRU Data Analytics Module Fifteen Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved utilizing R to perform statistical analysis on data regarding the MechCar and the dependent/indepent variables which relate to mpg and three production lots of suspension coils used in the vehicles.  

### Summary

The effort involved using R to load datasets regarding mpg and suspension coil lots.  Linear regression was performed on the MechCar attributes in relation to mpg.   Summary statistics and t-tests to determin lot variance vis-a-vis specifications was performed on the suspension coil data. T For each deliverable a specific set of questions to be answered were specified.  echnial analysis and written summary for each of four deliverables are outlined below:   

## Major components of the work:

# Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
This deliverable involved loading the data, performing linear regressions and three questions to answer were specified:

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


# Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
This deliverable involved creating summary a summary statistics table to show 
(a) The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots; and
(b)  PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.   The following question was posed to answer:

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?


# Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
This deliverable involved performing t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

* The question here is to briefly summarize interpretation and findings for the t-test results

# Deliverable 4: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
This deliverable involved designing a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.  Four questions were posed: 

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Deliverable 1) 

Linear regression on factors related to MPG produces the following result:

Statistical summar of the linear model are below and indicate that vehicle length and ground clearance are the independent variables with non-zero variance that contribute to MGP.  The p-value is far below significance, indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected and the slope of the linear model is non-zero:
